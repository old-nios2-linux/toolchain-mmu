<h3 class="section">D.5 General Query Packets</h3>

<p><a name="index-remote-query-requests-1765"></a>
Packets starting with <span class="samp">q</span> are <dfn>general query packets</dfn>;
packets starting with <span class="samp">Q</span> are <dfn>general set packets</dfn>.  General
query and set packets are a semi-unified form for retrieving and
sending information to and from the stub.

   <p>The initial letter of a query or set packet is followed by a name
indicating what sort of thing the packet applies to.  For example,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> may use a <span class="samp">qSymbol</span> packet to exchange symbol
definitions with the stub.  These packet names follow some
conventions:

     <ul>
<li>The name must not contain commas, colons or semicolons. 
<li>Most <span class="sc">gdb</span> query and set packets have a leading upper case
letter. 
<li>The names of custom vendor packets should use a company prefix, in
lower case, followed by a period.  For example, packets designed at
the Acme Corporation might begin with <span class="samp">qacme.foo</span> (for querying
foos) or <span class="samp">Qacme.bar</span> (for setting bars). 
</ul>

   <p>The name of a query or set packet should be separated from any
parameters by a <span class="samp">:</span>; the parameters themselves should be
separated by <span class="samp">,</span> or <span class="samp">;</span>.  Stubs must be careful to match the
full packet name, and check for a separator or the end of the packet,
in case two packet names share a common prefix.  New packets should not begin
with <span class="samp">qC</span>, <span class="samp">qP</span>, or <span class="samp">qL</span><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   <p>Like the descriptions of the other packets, each description here
has a template showing the packet's overall syntax, followed by an
explanation of the packet's meaning.  We include spaces in some of the
templates for clarity; these are not part of the packet's syntax.  No
<span class="sc">gdb</span> packet uses spaces to separate its components.

   <p>Here are the currently defined query and set packets:

Since there
may be too many active threads to fit into one reply packet, this query
works iteratively: it may require more than one query/reply sequence to
obtain the entire list of threads.  The first query of the sequence will
be the <span class="samp">qfThreadInfo</span> query; subsequent queries in the
sequence will be the <span class="samp">qsThreadInfo</span> query.

     <p>NOTE: This packet replaces the <span class="samp">qL</span> query (see below).

<br><dt><span class="samp">l</span><dd>(lower case letter <span class="samp">L</span>) denotes end of list. 
</dl>

     <p>In response to each query, the target will reply with a list of one or
more thread ids, in big-endian unsigned hex, separated by commas. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will respond to each reply with a request for more thread
ids (using the <span class="samp">qs</span> form of the query), until the target responds
with <span class="samp">l</span> (lower-case el, for <dfn>last</dfn>).

thread local variable.  (This offset is obtained from the debug
information associated with the variable.)

     <p><var>lm</var> is the (big endian, hex encoded) OS/ABI-specific encoding of the
the load module associated with the thread local storage.  For example,
a <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux system will pass the link map address of the shared
object associated with the thread local storage under consideration. 
Other operating environments may choose to represent the load module
differently, so the precise meaning of this parameter will vary.

Each listed <var>signal</var> should be passed directly to the inferior process. 
Signals are numbered identically to continue packets and stop replies
(see <a href="Stop-Reply-Packets.html#Stop-Reply-Packets">Stop Reply Packets</a>).  Each <var>signal</var> list item should be
strictly greater than the previous item.  These signals do not need to stop
the inferior, or be reported to <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  All other signals should be
reported to <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Multiple <span class="samp">QPassSignals</span> packets do not
combine; any earlier <span class="samp">QPassSignals</span> list is completely replaced by the
new list.  This packet improves performance when using <span class="samp">handle
</span><var>signal</var><span class="samp"> nostop noprint pass</span>.

     <p>Reply:
          <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">OK</span><dd>The request succeeded. 
</dl>

     <p>Use of this packet is controlled by the <code>set remote pass-signals</code>
command (see <a href="Remote-Configuration.html#Remote-Configuration">set remote pass-signals</a>). 
This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must request it,
by supplying an appropriate <span class="samp">qSupported</span> response (see <a href="qSupported.html#qSupported">qSupported</a>).

     <br><dt><span class="samp">qRcmd,</span><var>command</var><dd><a name="index-execute-remote-command_002c-remote-request-1781"></a><a name="index-_0040samp_007bqRcmd_007d-packet-1782"></a><var>command</var> (hex encoded) is passed to the local interpreter for
execution.  Invalid commands should be reported using the output
string.  Before the final result packet, the target may also respond
with a number of intermediate <span class="samp">O</span><var>output</var> console output
packets.  <em>Implementors should note that providing access to a
stubs's interpreter may have security implications</em>.

<dt><span class="samp">OK</span><dd>A command response with no output. 
<br><dt><var>OUTPUT</var><dd>A command response with the hex encoded output string <var>OUTPUT</var>.

     <p>(Note that the <code>qRcmd</code> packet's name is separated from the
command by a <span class="samp">,</span>, not a <span class="samp">:</span>, contrary to the naming
conventions above.  Please don't use this packet as a model for new
packets.)

     <br><dt><span class="samp">qSupported [:</span><var>gdbfeature</var><span class="samp"> [;</span><var>gdbfeature</var><span class="samp">]... ]</span><dd><a name="index-supported-packets_002c-remote-query-1783"></a><a name="index-features-of-the-remote-protocol-1784"></a><a name="index-_0040samp_007bqSupported_007d-packet-1785"></a><a name="qSupported"></a>
Tell the remote stub about features supported by <span class="sc">gdb</span>, and
query the stub for features it supports.  This packet allows
<span class="sc">gdb</span> and the remote stub to take advantage of each others'
features.  <span class="samp">qSupported</span> also consolidates multiple feature probes
at startup, to improve <span class="sc">gdb</span> performance&mdash;a single larger
packet performs better than multiple smaller probe packets on
high-latency links.  Some features may enable behavior which must not
be on by default, e.g. because it would confuse older clients or
stubs.  Other features may describe packets which could be
automatically probed for, but are not.  These features must be
reported before <span class="sc">gdb</span> will use them.  This &ldquo;default
unsupported&rdquo; behavior is not appropriate for all packets, but it
helps to keep the initial connection time under control with new
versions of <span class="sc">gdb</span> which support increasing numbers of packets.

     <p>Reply:
          <dl>
<dt><var>stubfeature</var><span class="samp"> [;</span><var>stubfeature</var><span class="samp">]...</span><dd>The stub supports or does not support each returned <var>stubfeature</var>,
depending on the form of each <var>stubfeature</var> (see below for the
possible forms). 
</dl>

     <p>The allowed forms for each feature (either a <var>gdbfeature</var> in the
<span class="samp">qSupported</span> packet, or a <var>stubfeature</var> in the response)
are:

          <dl>
<dt><var>name</var><span class="samp">=</span><var>value</var><dd>The remote protocol feature <var>name</var> is supported, and associated
with the specified <var>value</var>.  The format of <var>value</var> depends
on the feature, but it must not include a semicolon. 
<br><dt><var>name</var><span class="samp">+</span><dd>The remote protocol feature <var>name</var> is supported, and does not
need an associated value. 
<br><dt><var>name</var><span class="samp">-</span><dd>The remote protocol feature <var>name</var> is not supported. 
<br><dt><var>name</var><span class="samp">?</span><dd>The remote protocol feature <var>name</var> may be supported, and
<span class="sc">gdb</span> should auto-detect support in some other way when it is
needed.  This form will not be used for <var>gdbfeature</var> notifications,
but may be used for <var>stubfeature</var> responses. 
</dl>

     <p>Whenever the stub receives a <span class="samp">qSupported</span> request, the
supplied set of <span class="sc">gdb</span> features should override any previous
request.  This allows <span class="sc">gdb</span> to put the stub in a known
state, even if the stub had previously been communicating with
a different version of <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <p>No values of <var>gdbfeature</var> (for the packet sent by <span class="sc">gdb</span>)
are defined yet.  Stubs should ignore any unknown values for
<var>gdbfeature</var>.  Any <span class="sc">gdb</span> which sends a <span class="samp">qSupported</span>
packet supports receiving packets of unlimited length (earlier
versions of <span class="sc">gdb</span> may reject overly long responses).  Values
for <var>gdbfeature</var> may be defined in the future to let the stub take
advantage of new features in <span class="sc">gdb</span>, e.g. incompatible
improvements in the remote protocol&mdash;support for unlimited length
responses would be a <var>gdbfeature</var> example, if it were not implied by
the <span class="samp">qSupported</span> query.  The stub's reply should be independent
of the <var>gdbfeature</var> entries sent by <span class="sc">gdb</span>; first <span class="sc">gdb</span>
describes all the features it supports, and then the stub replies with
all the features it supports.

     <p>Similarly, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will silently ignore unrecognized stub feature
responses, as long as each response uses one of the standard forms.

     <p>Some features are flags.  A stub which supports a flag feature
should respond with a <span class="samp">+</span> form response.  Other features
require values, and the stub should respond with an <span class="samp">=</span>
form response.

     <p>Each feature has a default value, which <span class="sc">gdb</span> will use if
<span class="samp">qSupported</span> is not available or if the feature is not mentioned
in the <span class="samp">qSupported</span> response.  The default values are fixed; a
stub is free to omit any feature responses that match the defaults.

     <p>Not all features can be probed, but for those which can, the probing
mechanism is useful: in some cases, a stub's internal
architecture may not allow the protocol layer to know some information
about the underlying target in advance.  This is especially common in
stubs which may be configured for multiple targets.

     <p>These are the currently defined stub features and their properties:
