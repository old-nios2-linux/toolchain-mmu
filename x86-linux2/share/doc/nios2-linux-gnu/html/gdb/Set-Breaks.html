<h4 class="subsection">5.1.1 Setting Breakpoints</h4>

<!-- FIXME LMB what does GDB do if no code on line of breakpt? -->
<!-- consider in particular declaration with/without initialization. -->
<!-- FIXME 2 is there stuff on this already? break at fun start, already init? -->
<p><a name="index-break-189"></a><a name="index-b-_0040r_007b_0028_0040code_007bbreak_007d_0029_007d-190"></a><a name="index-g_t_0024bpnum_0040r_007b_002c-convenience-variable_007d-191"></a><a name="index-latest-breakpoint-192"></a>Breakpoints are set with the <code>break</code> command (abbreviated
<code>b</code>).  The debugger convenience variable `<samp><span class="samp">$bpnum</span></samp>' records the
number of the breakpoint you've set most recently; see <a href="Convenience-Vars.html#Convenience-Vars">Convenience Variables</a>, for a discussion of what you can do with
convenience variables.

   <p>You have several ways to say where the breakpoint should go.

     <dl>
<dt><code>break </code><var>function</var><dd>Set a breakpoint at entry to function <var>function</var>. 
When using source languages that permit overloading of symbols, such as
C<tt>++</tt>, <var>function</var> may refer to more than one possible place to break. 
See <a href="Breakpoint-Menus.html#Breakpoint-Menus">Breakpoint Menus</a>, for a discussion of that situation.

     <br><dt><code>break +</code><var>offset</var><dt><code>break -</code><var>offset</var><dd>Set a breakpoint some number of lines forward or back from the position
at which execution stopped in the currently selected <dfn>stack frame</dfn>. 
(See <a href="Frames.html#Frames">Frames</a>, for a description of stack frames.)

     <br><dt><code>break </code><var>linenum</var><dd>Set a breakpoint at line <var>linenum</var> in the current source file. 
The current source file is the last file whose source text was printed. 
The breakpoint will stop your program just before it executes any of the
code on that line.

     <br><dt><code>break </code><var>filename</var><code>:</code><var>linenum</var><dd>Set a breakpoint at line <var>linenum</var> in source file <var>filename</var>.

     <br><dt><code>break </code><var>filename</var><code>:</code><var>function</var><dd>Set a breakpoint at entry to function <var>function</var> found in file
<var>filename</var>.  Specifying a file name as well as a function name is
superfluous except when multiple files contain similarly named
functions.

     <br><dt><code>break *</code><var>address</var><dd>Set a breakpoint at address <var>address</var>.  You can use this to set
breakpoints in parts of your program which do not have debugging
information or source files.

     <br><dt><code>break</code><dd>When called without any arguments, <code>break</code> sets a breakpoint at
the next instruction to be executed in the selected stack frame
(see <a href="Stack.html#Stack">Examining the Stack</a>).  In any selected frame but the
innermost, this makes your program stop as soon as control
returns to that frame.  This is similar to the effect of a
<code>finish</code> command in the frame inside the selected frame&mdash;except
that <code>finish</code> does not leave an active breakpoint.  If you use
<code>break</code> without an argument in the innermost frame, <span class="sc">gdb</span> stops
the next time it reaches the current location; this may be useful
inside loops.

     <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> normally ignores breakpoints when it resumes execution, until at
least one instruction has been executed.  If it did not do this, you
would be unable to proceed past a breakpoint without first disabling the
breakpoint.  This rule applies whether or not the breakpoint already
existed when your program stopped.

     <br><dt><code>break ... if </code><var>cond</var><dd>Set a breakpoint with condition <var>cond</var>; evaluate the expression
<var>cond</var> each time the breakpoint is reached, and stop only if the
value is nonzero&mdash;that is, if <var>cond</var> evaluates as true. 
`<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>' stands for one of the possible arguments described
above (or no argument) specifying where to break.  See <a href="Conditions.html#Conditions">Break Conditions</a>, for more information on breakpoint conditions.

     <p><a name="index-tbreak-193"></a><br><dt><code>tbreak </code><var>args</var><dd>Set a breakpoint enabled only for one stop.  <var>args</var> are the
same as for the <code>break</code> command, and the breakpoint is set in the same
way, but the breakpoint is automatically deleted after the first time your
program stops there.  See <a href="Disabling.html#Disabling">Disabling Breakpoints</a>.

     <p><a name="index-hbreak-194"></a><a name="index-hardware-breakpoints-195"></a><br><dt><code>hbreak </code><var>args</var><dd>Set a hardware-assisted breakpoint.  <var>args</var> are the same as for the
<code>break</code> command and the breakpoint is set in the same way, but the
breakpoint requires hardware support and some target hardware may not
have this support.  The main purpose of this is EPROM/ROM code
debugging, so you can set a breakpoint at an instruction without
changing the instruction.  This can be used with the new trap-generation
provided by SPARClite DSU and most x86-based targets.  These targets
will generate traps when a program accesses some data or instruction
address that is assigned to the debug registers.  However the hardware
breakpoint registers can take a limited number of breakpoints.  For
example, on the DSU, only two data breakpoints can be set at a time, and
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will reject this command if more than two are used.  Delete
or disable unused hardware breakpoints before setting new ones
(see <a href="Disabling.html#Disabling">Disabling Breakpoints</a>). 
See <a href="Conditions.html#Conditions">Break Conditions</a>. 
For remote targets, you can restrict the number of hardware
breakpoints <span class="sc">gdb</span> will use, see <a href="set-remote-hardware_002dbreakpoint_002dlimit.html#set-remote-hardware_002dbreakpoint_002dlimit">set remote hardware-breakpoint-limit</a>.

     <p><a name="index-thbreak-196"></a><br><dt><code>thbreak </code><var>args</var><dd>Set a hardware-assisted breakpoint enabled only for one stop.  <var>args</var>
are the same as for the <code>hbreak</code> command and the breakpoint is set in
the same way.  However, like the <code>tbreak</code> command,
the breakpoint is automatically deleted after the
first time your program stops there.  Also, like the <code>hbreak</code>
command, the breakpoint requires hardware support and some target hardware
may not have this support.  See <a href="Disabling.html#Disabling">Disabling Breakpoints</a>. 
See also <a href="Conditions.html#Conditions">Break Conditions</a>.

     <p><a name="index-rbreak-197"></a><a name="index-regular-expression-198"></a><a name="index-breakpoints-in-functions-matching-a-regexp-199"></a><a name="index-set-breakpoints-in-many-functions-200"></a><br><dt><code>rbreak </code><var>regex</var><dd>Set breakpoints on all functions matching the regular expression
<var>regex</var>.  This command sets an unconditional breakpoint on all
matches, printing a list of all breakpoints it set.  Once these
breakpoints are set, they are treated just like the breakpoints set with
the <code>break</code> command.  You can delete them, disable them, or make
them conditional the same way as any other breakpoint.

     <p>The syntax of the regular expression is the standard one used with tools
like <samp><span class="file">grep</span></samp>.  Note that this is different from the syntax used by
shells, so for instance <code>foo*</code> matches all functions that include
an <code>fo</code> followed by zero or more <code>o</code>s.  There is an implicit
<code>.*</code> leading and trailing the regular expression you supply, so to
match only functions that begin with <code>foo</code>, use <code>^foo</code>.

     <p><a name="index-non_002dmember-C_0040t_007b_002b_002b_007d-functions_002c-set-breakpoint-in-201"></a>When debugging C<tt>++</tt> programs, <code>rbreak</code> is useful for setting
breakpoints on overloaded functions that are not members of any special
classes.

     <p><a name="index-set-breakpoints-on-all-functions-202"></a>The <code>rbreak</code> command can be used to set breakpoints in
<strong>all</strong> the functions in a program, like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) rbreak .
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-info-breakpoints-203"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0024_005f_007d-and-_0040code_007binfo-breakpoints_007d-204"></a><br><dt><code>info breakpoints </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>n</var><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>info break </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>n</var><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>info watchpoints </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>n</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Print a table of all breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints set and
not deleted.  Optional argument <var>n</var> means print information only
about the specified breakpoint (or watchpoint or catchpoint).  For
each breakpoint, following columns are printed:

          <dl>
<dt><em>Breakpoint Numbers</em><br><dt><em>Type</em><dd>Breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint. 
<br><dt><em>Disposition</em><dd>Whether the breakpoint is marked to be disabled or deleted when hit. 
<br><dt><em>Enabled or Disabled</em><dd>Enabled breakpoints are marked with `<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>'.  `<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>' marks breakpoints
that are not enabled. 
<br><dt><em>Address</em><dd>Where the breakpoint is in your program, as a memory address.  If the
breakpoint is pending (see below for details) on a future load of a shared library, the address
will be listed as `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;PENDING&gt;</span></samp>'. 
<br><dt><em>What</em><dd>Where the breakpoint is in the source for your program, as a file and
line number.  For a pending breakpoint, the original string passed to
the breakpoint command will be listed as it cannot be resolved until
the appropriate shared library is loaded in the future. 
</dl>

     <p class="noindent">If a breakpoint is conditional, <code>info break</code> shows the condition on
the line following the affected breakpoint; breakpoint commands, if any,
are listed after that.  A pending breakpoint is allowed to have a condition
specified for it.  The condition is not parsed for validity until a shared
library is loaded that allows the pending breakpoint to resolve to a
valid location.

     <p class="noindent"><code>info break</code> with a breakpoint
number <var>n</var> as argument lists only that breakpoint.  The
convenience variable <code>$_</code> and the default examining-address for
the <code>x</code> command are set to the address of the last breakpoint
listed (see <a href="Memory.html#Memory">Examining Memory</a>).

     <p class="noindent"><code>info break</code> displays a count of the number of times the breakpoint
has been hit.  This is especially useful in conjunction with the
<code>ignore</code> command.  You can ignore a large number of breakpoint
hits, look at the breakpoint info to see how many times the breakpoint
was hit, and then run again, ignoring one less than that number.  This
will get you quickly to the last hit of that breakpoint. 
</dl>

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> allows you to set any number of breakpoints at the same place in
your program.  There is nothing silly or meaningless about this.  When
the breakpoints are conditional, this is even useful
(see <a href="Conditions.html#Conditions">Break Conditions</a>).

   <p><a name="index-pending-breakpoints-205"></a>If a specified breakpoint location cannot be found, it may be due to the fact
that the location is in a shared library that is yet to be loaded.  In such
a case, you may want <span class="sc">gdb</span> to create a special breakpoint (known as
a <dfn>pending breakpoint</dfn>) that
attempts to resolve itself in the future when an appropriate shared library
gets loaded.

   <p>Pending breakpoints are useful to set at the start of your
<span class="sc">gdb</span> session for locations that you know will be dynamically loaded
later by the program being debugged.  When shared libraries are loaded,
a check is made to see if the load resolves any pending breakpoint locations. 
If a pending breakpoint location gets resolved,
a regular breakpoint is created and the original pending breakpoint is removed.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> provides some additional commands for controlling pending
breakpoint support:

   <p><a name="index-set-breakpoint-pending-206"></a><a name="index-show-breakpoint-pending-207"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><code>set breakpoint pending auto</code><dd>This is the default behavior.  When <span class="sc">gdb</span> cannot find the breakpoint
location, it queries you whether a pending breakpoint should be created.

     <br><dt><code>set breakpoint pending on</code><dd>This indicates that an unrecognized breakpoint location should automatically
result in a pending breakpoint being created.

     <br><dt><code>set breakpoint pending off</code><dd>This indicates that pending breakpoints are not to be created.  Any
unrecognized breakpoint location results in an error.  This setting does
not affect any pending breakpoints previously created.

     <br><dt><code>show breakpoint pending</code><dd>Show the current behavior setting for creating pending breakpoints. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-operations-allowed-on-pending-breakpoints-208"></a>Normal breakpoint operations apply to pending breakpoints as well.  You may
specify a condition for a pending breakpoint and/or commands to run when the
breakpoint is reached.  You can also enable or disable
the pending breakpoint.  When you specify a condition for a pending breakpoint,
the parsing of the condition will be deferred until the point where the
pending breakpoint location is resolved.  Disabling a pending breakpoint
tells <span class="sc">gdb</span> to not attempt to resolve the breakpoint on any subsequent
shared library load.  When a pending breakpoint is re-enabled,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> checks to see if the location is already resolved. 
This is done because any number of shared library loads could have
occurred since the time the breakpoint was disabled and one or more
of these loads could resolve the location.

   <p><a name="index-automatic-hardware-breakpoints-209"></a>For some targets, <span class="sc">gdb</span> can automatically decide if hardware or
software breakpoints should be used, depending on whether the
breakpoint address is read-only or read-write.  This applies to
breakpoints set with the <code>break</code> command as well as to internal
breakpoints set by commands like <code>next</code> and <code>finish</code>.  For
breakpoints set with <code>hbreak</code>, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will always use hardware
breakpoints.

   <p>You can control this automatic behaviour with the following commands::

   <p><a name="index-set-breakpoint-auto_002dhw-210"></a><a name="index-show-breakpoint-auto_002dhw-211"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><code>set breakpoint auto-hw on</code><dd>This is the default behavior.  When <span class="sc">gdb</span> sets a breakpoint, it
will try to use the target memory map to decide if software or hardware
breakpoint must be used.

     <br><dt><code>set breakpoint auto-hw off</code><dd>This indicates <span class="sc">gdb</span> should not automatically select breakpoint
type.  If the target provides a memory map, <span class="sc">gdb</span> will warn when
trying to set software breakpoint at a read-only address. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-negative-breakpoint-numbers-212"></a><a name="index-internal-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-breakpoints-213"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span> itself sometimes sets breakpoints in your program for
special purposes, such as proper handling of <code>longjmp</code> (in C
programs).  These internal breakpoints are assigned negative numbers,
starting with <code>-1</code>; `<samp><span class="samp">info breakpoints</span></samp>' does not display them. 
You can see these breakpoints with the <span class="sc">gdb</span> maintenance command
`<samp><span class="samp">maint info breakpoints</span></samp>' (see <a href="maint-info-breakpoints.html#maint-info-breakpoints">maint info breakpoints</a>).
