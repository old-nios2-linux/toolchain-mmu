<h2 class="chapter">2 Compiling a Program for Profiling</h2>

<p>The first step in generating profile information for your program is
to compile and link it with profiling enabled.

   <p>To compile a source file for profiling, specify the <span class="samp">-pg</span> option when
you run the compiler.  (This is in addition to the options you normally
use.)

   <p>To link the program for profiling, if you use a compiler such as <code>cc</code>
to do the linking, simply specify <span class="samp">-pg</span> in addition to your usual
options.  The same option, <span class="samp">-pg</span>, alters either compilation or linking
to do what is necessary for profiling.  Here are examples:

<pre class="example">     cc -g -c myprog.c utils.c -pg
     cc -o myprog myprog.o utils.o -pg
</pre>
   <p>The <span class="samp">-pg</span> option also works with a command that both compiles and links:

<pre class="example">     cc -o myprog myprog.c utils.c -g -pg
</pre>
   <p>Note: The <span class="samp">-pg</span> option must be part of your compilation options
as well as your link options.  If it is not then no call-graph data
will be gathered and when you run <code>gprof</code> you will get an error
message like this:

<pre class="example">     gprof: gmon.out file is missing call-graph data
</pre>
   <p>If you add the <span class="samp">-Q</span> switch to suppress the printing of the call
graph data you will still be able to see the time samples:

<pre class="example">     Flat profile:
     
     Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.
       %   cumulative   self              self     total
      time   seconds   seconds    calls  Ts/call  Ts/call  name
      44.12      0.07     0.07                             zazLoop
      35.29      0.14     0.06                             main
      20.59      0.17     0.04                             bazMillion
</pre>
   <p>If you run the linker <code>ld</code> directly instead of through a compiler
such as <code>cc</code>, you may have to specify a profiling startup file
<span class="file">gcrt0.o</span> as the first input file instead of the usual startup
file <span class="file">crt0.o</span>.  In addition, you would probably want to
specify the profiling C library, <span class="file">libc_p.a</span>, by writing
<span class="samp">-lc_p</span> instead of the usual <span class="samp">-lc</span>.  This is not absolutely
necessary, but doing this gives you number-of-calls information for
standard library functions such as <code>read</code> and <code>open</code>.  For
example:

<pre class="example">     ld -o myprog /lib/gcrt0.o myprog.o utils.o -lc_p
</pre>
   <p>If you compile only some of the modules of the program with <span class="samp">-pg</span>, you
can still profile the program, but you won't get complete information about
the modules that were compiled without <span class="samp">-pg</span>.  The only information
you get for the functions in those modules is the total time spent in them;
there is no record of how many times they were called, or from where.  This
will not affect the flat profile (except that the <code>calls</code> field for
the functions will be blank), but will greatly reduce the usefulness of the
call graph.

   <p>If you wish to perform line-by-line profiling,
you will also need to specify the <span class="samp">-g</span> option,
instructing the compiler to insert debugging symbols into the program
that match program addresses to source code lines. 
See <a href="Line_002dby_002dline.html#Line_002dby_002dline">Line-by-line Profiling</a>.

   <p>In addition to the <span class="samp">-pg</span> and <span class="samp">-g</span> options, older versions of
GCC required you to specify the <span class="samp">-a</span> option when compiling in
order to instrument it to perform basic-block counting.  Newer
versions do not require this option and will not accept it;
basic-block counting is always enabled when <span class="samp">-pg</span> is on.

   <p>When basic-block counting is enabled, as the program runs
it will count how many times it executed each branch of each <span class="samp">if</span>
statement, each iteration of each <span class="samp">do</span> loop, etc.  This will
enable <code>gprof</code> to construct an annotated source code
listing showing how many times each line of code was executed.

   <p>It also worth noting that GCC supports a different profiling method
which is enabled by the <span class="samp">-fprofile-arcs</span>, <span class="samp">-ftest-coverage</span>
and <span class="samp">-fprofile-values</span> switches. These switches do not produce
data which is useful to <code>gprof</code> however, so they are not
discussed further here.  There is also the
<span class="samp">-finstrument-functions</span> switch which will cause GCC to insert
calls to special user supplied instrumentation routines at the entry
and exit of every function in their program.  This can be used to
implement an alternative profiling scheme.
