<dl><dt><code>run</code><dt><code>r</code><dd>Use the <code>run</code> command to start your program under <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
You must first specify the program name (except on VxWorks) with an
argument to <span class="sc">gdb</span> (see <a href="Invocation.html#Invocation">Getting In and Out of <span class="sc">gdb</span></a>), or by using the <code>file</code> or <code>exec-file</code> command
(see <a href="Files.html#Files">Commands to Specify Files</a>).

   </dl>

   <p>If you are running your program in an execution environment that
supports processes, <code>run</code> creates an inferior process and makes
that process run your program.  (In environments without processes,
<code>run</code> jumps to the start of your program.)

   <p>The execution of a program is affected by certain information it
receives from its superior.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> provides ways to specify this
information, which you must do <em>before</em> starting your program.  (You
can change it after starting your program, but such changes only affect
your program the next time you start it.)  This information may be
divided into four categories:

     <dl>
<dt>The <em>arguments.</em><dd>Specify the arguments to give your program as the arguments of the
<code>run</code> command.  If a shell is available on your target, the shell
is used to pass the arguments, so that you may use normal conventions
(such as wildcard expansion or variable substitution) in describing
the arguments. 
In Unix systems, you can control which shell is used with the
<code>SHELL</code> environment variable. 
See <a href="Arguments.html#Arguments">Your Program's Arguments</a>.

     <br><dt>The <em>environment.</em><dd>Your program normally inherits its environment from <span class="sc">gdb</span>, but you can
use the <span class="sc">gdb</span> commands <code>set environment</code> and <code>unset
environment</code> to change parts of the environment that affect
your program.  See <a href="Environment.html#Environment">Your Program's Environment</a>.

     <br><dt>The <em>working directory.</em><dd>Your program inherits its working directory from <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  You can set
the <span class="sc">gdb</span> working directory with the <code>cd</code> command in <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
See <a href="Working-Directory.html#Working-Directory">Your Program's Working Directory</a>.

     <br><dt>The <em>standard input and output.</em><dd>Your program normally uses the same device for standard input and
standard output as <span class="sc">gdb</span> is using.  You can redirect input and output
in the <code>run</code> command line, or you can use the <code>tty</code> command to
set a different device for your program. 
See <a href="Input_002fOutput.html#Input_002fOutput">Your Program's Input and Output</a>.

     <p><a name="index-pipes-100"></a><em>Warning:</em> While input and output redirection work, you cannot use
pipes to pass the output of the program you are debugging to another
program; if you attempt this, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is likely to wind up debugging the
wrong program. 
</dl>

   <p>When you issue the <code>run</code> command, your program begins to execute
immediately.  See <a href="Stopping.html#Stopping">Stopping and Continuing</a>, for discussion
of how to arrange for your program to stop.  Once your program has
stopped, you may call functions in your program, using the <code>print</code>
or <code>call</code> commands.  See <a href="Data.html#Data">Examining Data</a>.

   <p>If the modification time of your symbol file has changed since the last
time <span class="sc">gdb</span> read its symbols, <span class="sc">gdb</span> discards its symbol
table, and reads it again.  When it does this, <span class="sc">gdb</span> tries to retain
your current breakpoints.

     
<a name="index-start-101"></a>
<dl><dt><code>start</code><dd><a name="index-run-to-main-procedure-102"></a>The name of the main procedure can vary from language to language. 
With C or C<tt>++</tt>, the main procedure name is always <code>main</code>, but
other languages such as Ada do not require a specific name for their
main procedure.  The debugger provides a convenient way to start the
execution of the program and to stop at the beginning of the main
procedure, depending on the language used.

     <p>The `<samp><span class="samp">start</span></samp>' command does the equivalent of setting a temporary
breakpoint at the beginning of the main procedure and then invoking
the `<samp><span class="samp">run</span></samp>' command.

     <p><a name="index-elaboration-phase-103"></a>Some programs contain an <dfn>elaboration</dfn> phase where some startup code is
executed before the main procedure is called.  This depends on the
languages used to write your program.  In C<tt>++</tt>, for instance,
constructors for static and global objects are executed before
<code>main</code> is called.  It is therefore possible that the debugger stops
before reaching the main procedure.  However, the temporary breakpoint
will remain to halt execution.

     <p>Specify the arguments to give to your program as arguments to the
`<samp><span class="samp">start</span></samp>' command.  These arguments will be given verbatim to the
underlying `<samp><span class="samp">run</span></samp>' command.  Note that the same arguments will be
reused if no argument is provided during subsequent calls to
`<samp><span class="samp">start</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">run</span></samp>'.

     <p>It is sometimes necessary to debug the program during elaboration.  In
these cases, using the <code>start</code> command would stop the execution of
your program too late, as the program would have already completed the
elaboration phase.  Under these circumstances, insert breakpoints in your
elaboration code before running your program.
